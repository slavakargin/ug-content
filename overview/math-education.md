# Math Education

For students interested in becoming math teachers, Binghamton offers:

- **BA/BS degrees in Mathematical Sciences.** Either the BA (Mathematics Track) or BS (Mathematics Track) is suitable preparation for a Masters in Teaching program. See {{UNIV_UG_LANDING}}.
- An **undergraduate minor in Education**: [Education Minor]({{BU_TLEL_EDUCATION_MINOR}})
- A **Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT)** in Mathematics Adolescent Education: [Adolescence Education Degree (MAT)]({{BU_TLEL_MAT_ADOLESCENCE_EDUCATION}})
- An **accelerated (4+1) program** in BA in Mathematical Sciences and MAT in Mathematics Adolescent Education: [4+1/Accelerated programs]({{BU_TLEL_ACCELERATED_PROGRAMS}})

The accelerated program allows well-prepared students to complete the Mathematics BA and Master of Arts in Teaching (Mathematics Adolescent Education) in 5 years. Transfer students are not eligible for the accelerated program. Students can also complete the bachelor’s and master’s program independently.

Most future math teachers choose to do the BA in mathematics.

## Recommended courses for future math teachers

There is no formal Education track within the math major, but here are some recommendations developed by the Math and Education faculty.

The requirements for the math BA include one course in Algebra, one course in Analysis, and one course in Geometry, as well as a pairing of two related courses. We recommend that within this, future math teachers aim for a broad mathematical background, including Statistics and including several proof-based courses. Proof-based courses are where you learn to express your mathematical ideas clearly, so they're particularly important for teachers.

- For the pairing, we recommend **Probability and Statistics** (MATH 447 and 448).
- For the Analysis course, we recommend future teachers choose from **Differential Equations**, **Dynamical Systems**, **Complex Analysis**, and (for those interested in a rigorous examination of Calculus) **Real Analysis**.
- For the Algebra course, we recommend future teachers choose from **Modern Algebra 1** and **Number Theory**.
- For the Geometry course, we recommend future teachers choose from **Differential Geometry** and **Foundations of Geometry**.
- For additional breadth, we recommend future teachers take a combinatorics course: either **Combinatorics** or **Graph Theory**.

Students are strongly advised to take Calculus courses as early as possible, since these are prerequisites for many later courses, and to take MATH 330 in the sophomore year, since MATH 330 is a prerequisite to all other proof-based courses. Beyond that, there are many good ways to fit these recommended courses into four years; here is a sample schedule.

| Year | Fall | Spring |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Calculus 1 (MATH 224 and 225) | Calculus 2 (MATH 226 and 227) |
| 2 | Calculus 3 (MATH 323), MATH 330 | Linear Algebra (MATH 304) |
| 3 | Probability (MATH 447), Algebra course | Statistics (MATH 448), Analysis course |
| 4 | Geometry course or Combinatorics (MATH 386) | Geometry course or Graph Theory (MATH 381) |
