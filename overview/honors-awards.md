# Honors, Awards and Scholarships

## Graduation with Departmental Honors

Every semester, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics grants some of our best graduating majors a distinction called **departmental honors**.

To receive the distinction, a student must, at a minimum, have at least a **3.5 GPA in the major courses**.

In addition, a student should either:
- be in a **BS** program, **or**
- if in a **BA** program, have a strong record of success in mathematics, statistics, or actuarial science (for example: above **3.9 GPA**, independent work in mathematics, substantially more math coursework than required by the BA program, substantially more actuarial exams passed than typical for the BA actuarial track, research activity in mathematics, etc.).

These are guiding criteria; the final decision is made by the **Undergraduate Committee** after careful review of students’ files.

The online form for **self-nomination** will be sent to all math majors by email. If you are a graduating student who has not received the email containing the link to the self-nomination form **4–5 weeks into the semester**, please contact the **Director of Undergraduate Studies**: [Contact information]({{BU_MATH_CONTACT_INFO}}).

The department also hosts a [local chapter]({{BU_PME_LOCAL_CHAPTER}}) of [Pi Mu Epsilon](https://pme-math.org/), the National Mathematics Honor Society.

## Awarding Excellence

In addition to graduation honors, the department grants several awards each year to students who have made outstanding achievements in the mathematical sciences:

- **Award for Excellence in Mathematical Sciences** — presented to outstanding graduating seniors majoring in mathematical sciences.
- **Helen P. Beard Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Mathematics** — established by Gerald Miller ’67 in honor of Professor Emeritus Helen Pearl Beard (retired 1982; passed away January 2004). Presented to a junior or senior major who demonstrates qualities exemplified by Professor Beard.
- **Lawrence I. Wilkins Scholarship** — awarded to a Harpur student majoring in math with academic excellence. Recipients are selected in the spring for the following academic year.
- **Miguel Arcones Memorial Award** — established in 2013 to honor the memory of Professor Miguel Arcones. Awarded to a graduating senior who has demonstrated academic excellence. Preference is given to a student in the actuarial program.
- **Actuarial Science Award** — awarded to actuarial science students with academic excellence.
- **Award for Putnam Competition and Problem Solving** — awarded to undergraduate majors in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics who participated in and received good results in the Putnam Mathematics Competition and/or the Problem of the Week problem-solving series.

Many awards are made possible because of donations from our alumni and friends. Consider [making donations]({{BU_MATH_GIVE}}) to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.
