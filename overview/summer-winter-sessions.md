# Summer and Winter Sessions

Summer and winter courses can be a great way to stay on track, explore electives, or catch up on prerequisites. The key question is **where** you take the course.

## Option 1: Take the course at Binghamton
If the course is offered at BU, you can enroll normally. If you’re not sure what fits your plan, start with advising.

## Option 2: Take the course elsewhere and transfer it back
If you want to take a math/stats course at another institution and use it toward the major/minor, you should check equivalencies and (when needed) get pre-approval before registering.

- Check equivalencies first: [Pre-approved Transfer Table]({{BU_PREAPPROVED_TRANSFER_TABLE}})
- Exam credit (AP/IB/CLEP) policies: [Harpur transfer credit policies]({{BU_HARPUR_TRANSFER_CREDIT_POLICIES}})
- Department instructions (what to send, when pre-approval is required): [Transfer credit guidance]({{DEPT_TRANSFER_CREDIT_GUIDANCE}})

## Study abroad and courses outside the U.S.
Some non-U.S. coursework can transfer, but short-term summer/winter courses abroad are often restricted unless taken through approved programs.
