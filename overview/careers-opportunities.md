# Careers and Opportunities

Mathematics, statistics, and data science are “portable” degrees: you build skills in modeling, computation, and careful reasoning that apply across many industries and to graduate/professional study.

This page focuses on stable resources and common pathways. For forms, deadlines, and other frequently updated information, see the [Current Students Hub]({{DEPT_CURRENT_STUDENTS_HUB}}).

## Common directions after graduation

### Data science, statistics, and analytics
Typical roles: data analyst, statistical analyst, entry-level data scientist, BI/analytics, research assistant, quantitative roles in many fields.

A strong pathway is the **Data Science & Statistics track**:

- [Data Science & Statistics track (BA/BS)](../tracks/data-science/)

### Actuarial science and risk
Typical roles: actuarial analyst, risk analyst, insurance analytics, pensions/retirement, healthcare analytics.

See the track page:

- [Actuarial Science track (BA/BS)](../tracks/actuarial/)

Professional advancement typically involves actuarial exams; the main professional society is:

- [Society of Actuaries (SOA)]({{SOA_HOME}})

### Mathematics and quantitative careers
Typical directions: operations research, quantitative finance, modeling/simulation, software/engineering-adjacent roles, graduate study.

See the track page:

- [Mathematics track (BA/BS)](../tracks/pure-math/)

### Teaching pathway
If you are considering teaching mathematics, start with:

- [Math Education (Teaching)](../overview/math-education/)

## Experiences that make applications strong

These are the “high-signal” items employers and graduate programs tend to value:

1. **Projects with real data or real problems**  
   (course projects, independent study, research, internships)

2. **Computing and communication**  
   (clear writing, presentations, reproducible code)

3. **One sustained experience** (a semester or a summer)  
   rather than many small, disconnected items

Useful starting points:

- Research and scholarships: [ESURC]({{BU_ESURC_HOME}})
- Internships/jobs and recruiting: [Fleishman Center]({{BU_FLEISHMAN_CENTER_HOME}})

- [American Statistical Association (ASA) — Statistics Students]({{ASA_STATS_STUDENTS}})
- [Society of Actuaries (SOA)]({{SOA_HOME}})

## Next step checklist

- Pick **one** direction to explore first (actuarial / data / grad school / teaching / other).
- Have one career conversation (Fleishman) and one academic conversation (advising).
- Choose one experience to pursue this term (project, research, internship search, or exam plan).
- Keep a one-page running document: skills, projects, and what you learned (it becomes your resume content).
