# Careers and Opportunities

Mathematics, statistics, and data science are “portable” degrees: you build skills in modeling, computation, and careful reasoning that apply across many industries and to graduate/professional study.

This page focuses on stable resources and common pathways. For forms, deadlines, and other frequently updated information, see {{DEPT_CURRENT_STUDENTS_HUB}}.

## Start here (three reliable hubs)

- **Career exploration + internships + jobs:** {{BU_FLEISHMAN_CENTER_HOME}}  
  (career advising, resumes, internships, job search tools, recruiting)

- **Undergraduate research + scholarships:** {{BU_ESURC_HOME}}  
  (research opportunities, funding, and scholarship support)

- **Department advising hub (dynamic):** {{DEPT_CURRENT_STUDENTS_HUB}}  
  (degree planning, petitions, local policies, “what to take next”)

## Common directions after graduation

### Data science, statistics, and analytics
Typical roles: data analyst, statistical analyst, data scientist (entry level), BI/analytics, research assistant, quantitative marketing/finance.

A strong pathway is the **Data Science & Statistics track**: see the track page in this site:

- [Data Science & Statistics track (BA/BS)](../tracks/data-science/)

### Actuarial science and risk
Typical roles: actuarial analyst, risk analyst, insurance analytics, pensions/retirement, healthcare analytics.

See the track page in this site:

- [Actuarial Science track (BA/BS)](../tracks/actuarial/)

Actuarial careers also involve professional exams; the primary professional society is:

- {{SOA_HOME}}

### Mathematics and quantitative careers
Typical roles: operations research, quantitative finance, modeling/simulation, software/engineering-adjacent roles, graduate study in math/applied math.

See the track page in this site:

- [Mathematics track (BA/BS)](../tracks/pure-math/)

### Teaching pathway
If you are considering teaching mathematics, start with:

- [Math Education (Teaching)](../overview/math-education/)

## Experiences that make applications strong

These are the “high-signal” items employers and graduate programs tend to value:

1. **Projects with real data or real problems**  
   (course projects, independent study, research, internships)

2. **Computing and communication**  
   (writing clearly, presenting results, reproducible code)

3. **One sustained experience** (a semester or a summer)  
   rather than many small, disconnected items

For research and scholarship pathways, ESURC is the right entry point:

- {{BU_ESURC_HOME}}

For internships/jobs and recruiting pipelines:

- {{BU_FLEISHMAN_CENTER_HOME}}

## National career resources (quick reality checks)

- **BLS “Math occupations” overview:** {{BLS_OOH_MATH_HOME}}  
  (typical work, pay ranges, outlook, related roles)

- **ASA student career resources (statistics/data science):** {{ASA_STATS_STUDENTS}}  

- **SOA (actuarial careers and exams):** {{SOA_HOME}}

## Next step checklist (simple, effective)

- Pick **one** direction to explore first (actuarial / data / grad school / teaching / other).
- Book one career conversation (Fleishman) and one academic conversation (advising).
- Choose one experience to pursue this term (project, research, internship search, or exam plan).
- Keep a one-page running document: skills, projects, and what you learned (it becomes your resume content).
