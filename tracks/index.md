# Tracks in Mathematical Sciences

The Mathematical Sciences major offers several **tracks**. A track is a coherent pathway through the major designed around a particular set of goals (breadth in mathematics, actuarial preparation, or statistics/data science).  

**Authoritative degree requirements** live in the University Academic Guide (Catalog):

- [Academic Guide — BA]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BA}})
- [Academic Guide — BS]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BS}})

For advising, forms, and semester-by-semester planning resources (dynamic information), see the department’s current-students hub:

## Track options

### Mathematics (BA/BS)
For students who want broad exposure to core areas of mathematics (analysis, algebra, geometry/topology) and flexibility to shape a coherent set of electives.

- Best for: students considering graduate study in math/statistics, or anyone who wants a strong general mathematics foundation.
- Degree intensity: **BA** is flexible; **BS** is more intensive and is typically better preparation for graduate study.

### Actuarial Science (BA/BS)
For students preparing for actuarial careers in insurance, risk, retirement, and related areas, with coursework aligned to professional exams and industry expectations.

- Best for: students planning to pursue actuarial exams and actuarial internships.
- Notes: professional advancement typically includes passing a sequence of actuarial exams.

→ [Actuarial Science Track (BA/BS)](actuarial/)

### Data Science & Statistics (BA/BS)
For students who want a modern statistics + computing foundation for data-driven work across science, engineering, business, and the social sciences.

- Best for: students interested in data science/statistics careers or graduate study that uses statistics, modeling, and computation.
- Typical complements: CS, biology, psychology, economics, finance, management, and other data-rich fields.

## How to choose a track

A few practical decision cues:

- **You like proof-based “core math”** and want maximum flexibility → **Mathematics (BA)**  
- **You want a more intensive math program** and may consider graduate study → **Mathematics (BS)**  
- **You want a clearly professional pathway** with exams/internships as milestones → **Actuarial (BA/BS)**  
- **You want strong statistics + computing** and plan to work with data → **Data Science & Statistics (BA/BS)**

If you’re unsure, start with the shared foundation (calculus + linear algebra) and talk to advising early:
