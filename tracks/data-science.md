# Data Science & Statistics track (BA/BS)

Data science and statistics focus on turning raw data into reliable insight and decisions in the presence of uncertainty. The field combines statistical modeling, computing, and domain knowledge, with applications across the natural and social sciences, business, engineering, and the humanities.

## BA in Mathematical Sciences (Data Science & Statistics track)
The BA track in Data Science & Statistics is designed to provide a strong mathematical and statistical foundation together with modern data-science tools, while leaving room for a second major or minor. Students complete core coursework in calculus, linear algebra, probability, mathematical statistics, regression, and statistical learning, together with a computing-intensive course and a practical experience in data analysis (for example, an internship, research project, or consulting course).

This track works especially well in combination with majors such as computer science, biology, psychology, economics, finance, accounting, management, or other social and natural sciences.

To earn the BA degree in Mathematical Sciences (Data Science & Statistics track), students must complete the required core and elective courses described in the University Bulletin and on the departmental planning sheets. The approximate number of credits is **52–56**.

## BS in Mathematical Sciences (Data Science & Statistics track)
The BS track in Data Science & Statistics is a more intensive program aimed at students who want a deeper mathematical and computational background for graduate study or technically demanding careers in data science, statistics, or related fields.

In addition to the core courses shared with the BA track (calculus, linear algebra, probability, mathematical statistics, regression, statistical learning, and computing), BS students take further upper-level mathematics and statistics, such as real analysis, advanced linear algebra, optimization, stochastic processes, or related topics. They also complete additional advanced electives and a practical experience in data analysis.

Students considering the BS track are strongly encouraged to consult with their academic advisors early and to plan their schedules carefully to meet the more demanding requirements.

To earn the BS degree in Mathematical Sciences (Data Science & Statistics track), students must complete all required core and elective coursework specified in the University Bulletin and departmental degree-planning materials. The approximate number of credits is **64–68**.
