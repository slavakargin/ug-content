# Mathematics track (BA/BS)

## BA in Mathematical Sciences (Mathematics track)
The BA in Mathematical Sciences is designed to be flexible, allowing students to build a course of study that fits their interests, with options to emphasize breadth or depth. Students are encouraged to explore multiple areas of mathematics.

**Core areas** include:

- Analysis

- Algebra

- Geometry/Topology

Additional areas often include Actuarial Science, Statistics, Combinatorics, Computer Science, and related fields.

At the upper level, BA students complete **one course in each core area**, plus **two additional upper-level courses** (chosen to match the student’s interests and goals).

To earn the BA degree in Mathematical Sciences (Mathematics track), a student must complete **at least 40 credits** of coursework.

For the authoritative requirements, see [Academic Guide - BA]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BA}}).

## BS in Mathematical Sciences (Mathematics track)
The BS in Mathematical Sciences is a significantly more intensive program that provides excellent preparation for graduate study in mathematics and related disciplines. Because the requirements are demanding, students considering the BS should consult their academic advisors early and plan schedules carefully.

To earn the BS degree in Mathematical Sciences (Mathematics track), a student must complete **at least 64 credits** of coursework.

For the authoritative requirements, see [Academic Guide - BS]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BS}}).
