# Actuarial Science track (BA/BS)

The Actuarial Science track is designed to prepare students for an actuarial career. Actuaries use probability models to quantify uncertainty and risk in business problems. They assemble and analyze data related to risks in order to answer questions such as how much to charge policyholders for auto, life, or health insurance, how to design retirement plans, and how to formulate investment strategies in light of future risks. They provide crucial evaluations of risk that inform their companies’ strategic decisions.

Because of their central role in decision making, actuaries are well compensated. Salaries offered to actuaries are substantial, and there is ample opportunity for advancement in the actuarial profession. Actuarial careers often lead to upper-management and executive positions.

Professional advancement typically results from passing a series of examinations administered by actuarial societies and from completing specific courses approved by these societies.
