# Requirements and your catalog year

The official degree requirements for Mathematical Sciences are defined in the **Academic Guide (catalog)**. The requirements that apply to you depend on your **catalog year** (usually the year you entered Binghamton, with some exceptions).

## Start here (authoritative)
- **BA requirements (Academic Guide):** [Mathematical Sciences BA]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BA}})
- **BS requirements (Academic Guide):** [Mathematical Sciences BS]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BS}})

## If something looks inconsistent
DegreeWorks is helpful, but not perfect. If you think a course is not counting correctly, contact advising and include:
- your **B-number**
- your major/track and expected graduation term
- a brief description of what you expected to count (screenshots help)
