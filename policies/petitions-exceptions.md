# Petitions and exceptions

Some requests require a formal review. Common examples include:

- prerequisite exceptions
- course substitutions
- transfer course approvals (when not pre-approved)
- DegreeWorks adjustments

## Before you submit
Prepare:

- your **B-number**
- the course(s) in question and the term
- a brief explanation of what you are requesting and why
- supporting documentation (syllabus for transfers; catalog description; relevant emails/screenshots)

## Where to submit / what forms to use
The department maintains the current instructions and links to the correct forms here:

- [Current Students Hub (forms, petitions, advising)]({{DEPT_CURRENT_STUDENTS_HUB}})

## Typical turnaround
Many requests can be handled quickly, but time varies by volume and documentation. If your request affects registration, submit early.
