# Transfer credit and exam credit (AP / IB / CLEP)

There are two common ways to earn credit without taking the BU course:

1) credit by **exam** (AP/IB/CLEP), and  
2) **transfer credit** from another institution.

## Exam credit (AP / IB / CLEP)
Harpur Advising maintains the official policies and equivalencies:

- [Transfer credit policies]({{BU_HARPUR_TRANSFER_CREDIT_POLICIES}})
- [AP equivalencies]({{BU_HARPUR_AP_EQUIVALENCIES}})
- [International Baccalaureate (IB)]({{BU_HARPUR_IB_CREDIT}})
- [CLEP]({{BU_HARPUR_CLEP_CREDIT}})

## Transfer credit from another institution (including summer/winter elsewhere)

### Step 1 — Check if it is already pre-approved
Use the university’s pre-approved table:

- [Pre-approved Transfer Table]({{BU_PREAPPROVED_TRANSFER_TABLE}})

If your course appears there with the correct BU equivalent, you typically do not need a separate petition.

### Step 2 — If it is not pre-approved, request Math/Stats review before registering
For Math/Stats courses that will be used toward the major/minor, you should request department guidance in advance:

- [Department transfer credit guidance (what to send)]({{DEPT_TRANSFER_CREDIT_GUIDANCE}})

## Courses outside the U.S.
Some non-U.S. coursework can transfer, but short-term summer/winter courses abroad are often restricted unless taken through approved programs:
