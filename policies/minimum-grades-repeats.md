# Minimum grades and repeats

Some major requirements (and many prerequisites) require a **minimum grade**. Policies can differ by requirement, so when in doubt, use the Academic Guide and confirm with advising.

## Practical guidance
- For major requirements: A grade of **C or better** is required.
- For prerequisites: a grade of **C- or better** is commonly required for lower-division courses, and **C or better** for upper-division courses but not every course uses the same cutoff. Use the Academic Guide as the official source for what grade is required.
- Repeating a course: the university and/or department may limit how many times a course can be attempted for major progress. If you are planning a repeat (or already repeated a course), check with advising early.

## Where to confirm (authoritative + advising)
- **BA requirements (Academic Guide):** [Mathematical Sciences BA]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BA}})
- **BS requirements (Academic Guide):** [Mathematical Sciences BS]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BS}})
- **Department guidance and exceptions:** [Current Students Hub]({{DEPT_CURRENT_STUDENTS_HUB}})

## If you need an exception
Requests like prerequisite exceptions, substitutions, or DegreeWorks adjustments are handled through the department process:
